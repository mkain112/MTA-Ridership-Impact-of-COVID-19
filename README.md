## How COVID-19 Effected MTA Usage in NYC

  I am a New Yorker, living in Queens, who takes the MTA daily; well, I used to until the quarentines started. One thing I noticed the times I did take the subway was that it is alot less crowded than it usually is. That had me thinking, was it just me or was this the actual case. That is what lead me to do this project and find out if it was all in my head or this was a reality. In this analysis, I perform some Exploritory Data Analysis (EDA) on turnstile data from 2019 and 2020, as well COVID-19 data for the city of New York. I perform a few Hypothesis Tests to see if there was a difference in turnstile usage and how coronavirus cases and tests given correlate with median household income levels. My goal is to find out if COVID-19 had an effect on MTA usage and to find out what nieghborhoods did it effect more.
